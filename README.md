# Connect 4 w/ Opponnent

This project was done for a second year curricular unit (InteligÃªncia Artificial).

Using Python, I implemented a series of search algorithms that constitute an adversary for the Connect 4 game!<br>
Further rules about the game can be read here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four

The search algorithms implemented were:
- Minimax
- Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Monte Carlo Tree Search
